_(Updated during [Session #55 üë®‚Äçüíª April 2025](https://session.pestilenz.org/))_

## Development

This repo is using PHP and Composer from <https://github.com/ramdacxp/php-devenv>, which needs to be cloned into a _parallel_ folder `php-devenv`.

A Maria DB plus webserver hosting [PHPMyAdmin](http://127.0.0.1:8181) can be started via:

```cmd
database
```

In a development shell `composer` can be used to install required PHP packages and to start a development webserver, which then serves the project at locally at <http://localhost:8080/>:

```cmd
devenv
composer install
composer start
```
